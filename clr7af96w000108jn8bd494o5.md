Ansible ad hoc commands are one-liners designed to achieve a very specific task they are like quick snippets and your compact swiss army knife when you want to do a quick task across multiple machines.

To put simply, Ansible ad hoc commands are one-liner Linux shell commands and playbooks are like a shell script, a collective of many commands with logic.

Ansible ad hoc commands come handy when you want to perform a quick task.

# Task-01

* write an ansible ad hoc ping command to ping 3 servers from inventory file
    
* Write an ansible ad hoc command to check uptime
    

**1\. Pinging Servers**

Before diving into any action, it's crucial to ensure that your servers are reachable. Use the following Ansible ad hoc command to ping three servers from your inventory file:

```plaintext
ansible server1:server2 -m ping -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command utilizes the `ping` module to check the availability of the specified servers.

**2\. Checking Uptime**

To get insights into server uptime, use the `uptime` command through Ansible ad hoc:

```plaintext
ansible all -m command -a uptime -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command utilizes the `command` module to execute the `uptime` command on all servers in your inventory.

**3\. Monitoring Memory Usage**

Keeping an eye on memory usage is essential for server health. You can use Ansible to check memory usage with the following command:

```plaintext
ansible all -a "free -m" -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

Here, the `free -m` command is executed on all servers to display memory usage statistics.

**4\. Retrieving Physical Memory Information**

To fetch information about the physical memory allocated to your servers, you can use this command:

```plaintext
ansible all -m shell -a "cat /proc/meminfo|head -2" -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command uses the `shell` module to execute a command that displays the first two lines of the `/proc/meminfo` file on each server.

**5\. Checking Disk Space**

Checking disk space is vital for maintaining server storage. Ansible allows you to check disk space on all hosts in your inventory:

```plaintext
ansible all -m shell -a 'df -h' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

The `df -h` command is executed on all servers to show disk space usage.

**6\. Listing Running Processes**

To see a list of all running processes on a specific host in your inventory file, you can use this command:

```plaintext
ansible specific_host -m command -a 'ps aux' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command employs the `command` module to execute the `ps aux` command on the specified host.

**7\. Executing Commands with Sudo**

Sometimes, you need elevated permissions to perform certain tasks. Ansible allows you to run commands with `sudo`. For example:

```plaintext
ansible all -b -m shell -a 'sudo-command' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

Replace `'sudo-command'` with your desired command. This command becomes especially useful for tasks like installing software, checking versions, or managing system services.

* To check if Docker is installed on all three servers:
    

```plaintext
ansible all -b -m shell -a 'sudo apt-get install docker.io -y' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

* To check the Docker version on all three servers:
    

```plaintext
ansible all -b -m shell -a 'sudo docker --version' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

* To check the git version on all three servers:
    

```plaintext
ansible all -b -m shell -a 'sudo git --version' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

**8\. Service Status Check**

To verify the status of a specific service on all hosts in your inventory, use the `service` module:

```plaintext
ansible all -m service -a 'name=docker state=started' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command checks if the Docker service is started on all servers. You can replace `"docker"` with the name of any other service you want to monitor, such as Apache, Nginx, or Jenkins.

For checking the status on a single server (e.g., server1):

```plaintext
ansible server1 -m service -a 'name=docker state=started' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

**9\. Copying Files**

Copying files to multiple hosts can be accomplished with Ansible. Here's how you can copy a file to all hosts in your inventory:

```plaintext
ansible all -m copy -a 'src=/local/path/to/file dest=/remote/path/to/file mode=0644' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command uses the `copy` module to copy a file from the local machine to all hosts in your inventory. The `mode=0644` argument specifies the desired file permissions.

To check if the file is successfully copied to all servers, you can use:

```plaintext
ansible all -b -m shell -a 'sudo ls /remote/path/to/file' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

**10\. Creating Directories**

If you need to create directories on your servers, Ansible can help with that too. For example, to create a directory with `755` permissions:

```plaintext
ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ubuntu/ansible state=directory mode=0755" -b -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command uses the `file` module to create a directory at the specified path with the specified permissions.

**11\. Creating Files**

Creating files with specific permissions is another task you can tackle with Ansible. To create a file with `755` permissions:

```plaintext
ansible all -m file -a "path=/path/to/file state=touch mode=0755" -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```

This command utilizes the `file` module to create a file with the specified permissions.

To confirm that the file was created with the given permissions, use the following command:

```plaintext
ansible all -b -m shell -a 'sudo ls -l /path/to/file' -i /path/to/inventory/file --key-file=~<private_key_path>
```
