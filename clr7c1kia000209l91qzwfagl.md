Ansible playbooks run multiple tasks, assign roles, and define configurations, deployment steps, and variables. If youâ€™re using multiple servers, Ansible playbooks organize the steps between the assembled machines or servers and get them organized and running in the way the users need them to. Consider playbooks as the equivalent of instruction manuals.

### Task-01

* Write an ansible playbook to create a file on a different server
    
* Write an ansible playbook to create a new user.
    
* Write an ansible playbook to install docker on a group of servers
    

### **Key components of an Ansible playbook include:**

1. **Hosts:** Specifies the target hosts or groups on which the playbook tasks will be executed.
    
2. **Tasks:** Describes a list of actions or operations to be performed on the target hosts. Each task typically corresponds to an Ansible module that carries out a specific action, such as installing a package, copying files, or restarting services.
    
3. **Plays:** A play is a set of tasks that are executed on a specific group of hosts. Plays allow you to organize and structure your automation tasks logically.
    
4. **Handlers:** Handlers are tasks that respond to specific events triggered by other tasks in the playbook. For example, restarting a service after a configuration file change.
    
5. **Variables:** Ansible playbooks can use variables to make them more flexible and reusable. Variables can be defined within the playbook or in external files.
    

### Basic Syntax:

```plaintext
---
- name: Playbook Name
  hosts: target_hosts
  become: yes  # Optional, to execute tasks with elevated privileges
  vars:
    variable_name: variable_value  # Optional, define variables for the playbook

  tasks:
    - name: Task 1 Description
      module_name:
        parameter1: value1
        parameter2: value2

    - name: Task 2 Description
      module_name:
        parameter1: value1
        parameter2: value2

  handlers:
    - name: Handler 1
      module_name:
        parameter1: value1
        parameter2: value2

    - name: Handler 2
      module_name:
        parameter1: value1
        parameter2: value2
```

**Explanation:**

* `name`: Descriptive name for the playbook, tasks, and handlers.
    
* `hosts`: Specifies the target hosts or groups on which the playbook tasks will be executed.
    
* `become`: (Optional) Indicates whether tasks should be executed with elevated privileges (sudo).
    
* `vars`: (Optional) Define variables for the playbook to enhance flexibility.
    
* `tasks`: List of tasks to be executed on the target hosts. Each task involves a specific Ansible module and its parameters.
    
* `handlers`: (Optional) List of handlers, which are tasks triggered by specific events. Handlers are defined separately but are called by tasks when needed.

### Tasks:

### Write an ansible playbook to create a file on a different server

**Step 1: Create the playbook file (**`create_file.yml`):

**Step 2: Write the Content:**

```plaintext
---
- name: Create a file on a different server
  hosts: your_target_server  # Replace with the hostname or IP of your target server
  become: true  # To run tasks with elevated privileges

  tasks:
    - name: Create a file
      file:
        path: /path/to/remote/file.txt  # Replace with the desired remote path and filename
        state: touch
```

* Open your preferred text editor (e.g., VSCode, Nano, Vim) and paste the content of the playbook into a new file named `create_file.yml`.
    
* Replace `your_target_server` with the actual hostname or IP address of the server where you want to create the file.
    
* Modify `/path/to/remote/file.txt` to the desired path and filename on the remote server.
