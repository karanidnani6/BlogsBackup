        aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket-name/your-file-name /path/to/local/destination
        ```
        
2. **Verify File Contents:**
    
    * SSH into both EC2 instances.
        
    * Use a text editor or command-line tools to view the contents of the downloaded file on both instances. You can use `cat`, `less`, or any text editor of your choice.
